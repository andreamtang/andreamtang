# Hi there, I'm Andrea ðŸ‘‹
I'm a recent grad of the University of British Columbia, where I studied Cognitive Systems. I'm currently seeking full time web development opportunities where I can share my passion for bulding meaningfully designed digital experiences. I have worked with object oriented programming languages, web applications, and game development.
## Previously...
- I implemented my original redesign for the [DTQC Quantum Hub](https://github.com/dtquantumc/quantum-hub)
- I spent my co-op placement at [PNI Media](https://www.pnimedia.com/)
- I led a [UBC Emerging Media Lab](https://github.com/ubcemergingmedialab) team in developing a VR tool for music students
- I developed a chatbot for [Synaptitude Brain Health](https://synaptitudebrainhealth.com/) as part of my COGS 402 research project
